## Data Preparation

In this exercise, you will perform an **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA)

### Data Schema

✏️ Your first challenge is to build the data schema of `olist` using [kitt.lewagon.com/db](https://kitt.lewagon.com/db). Don't forget to quick-save it regularly ("F2") to your Kitt profile.

We have written for you a detailed description of the data schema in `data/csv/README.md`.  
The `.md` format (called "Markdown") is better rendered visually using github.

Use the command below to see this `README` on your GitHub:  
```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}/data/
gh browse .
```

### Data Loader

We'll load csv data in a Python class and pandas DataFrame, which will come in handy throughout the week.
